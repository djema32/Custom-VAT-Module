Custom VAT Module
=================

A module programmed in Python for Odoo that enhances the webshop by displaying both VAT-inclusive and VAT-exclusive prices for products.

Features
--------

1. **Product List Page**
   - Displays the VAT-exclusive price directly beneath the VAT-inclusive price for every product listed on the webshop.
   - Makes it easy for customers to compare prices and understand the tax breakdown.

2. **Product Detail Page**
   - Shows the VAT-exclusive price next to the VAT-inclusive price on individual product pages.
   - Ensures clarity by presenting both price formats in a clean and professional layout.

3. **Configurable Option**
   - The dual price display is optional and can be configured via the website or product settings.
   - Offers flexibility for businesses to enable or disable the feature based on their needs.

4. **Tax Configuration on Product Level**
   - The module uses the tax information configured on the product form to calculate VAT-inclusive and VAT-exclusive prices.
   - This ensures the displayed prices are accurate and aligned with the product's tax settings.

Benefits
--------

- **Enhanced Transparency**: Customers can clearly see the tax breakdown, which builds trust and confidence.
- **Legal Compliance**: Supports businesses operating in regions where displaying VAT-inclusive and VAT-exclusive prices is required.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The prices are seamlessly integrated into the existing webshop design, maintaining a polished appearance.
